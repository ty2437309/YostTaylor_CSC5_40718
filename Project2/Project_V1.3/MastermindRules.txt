Rules of Mastermind:

The game of Mastermind is played with two players. One player is
the Code-Maker, while one is the Code-Breaker. The goal of the
Code-Breaker is to guess the code made by the Code-Maker. Should
the Code-Breaker fail to guess correctly within ten turns, the
game is lost and you may play again.

Job of Code-Breaker: The Code-Breaker will have to guess both the
correct color and order of the code. Using feedback from the
Code-Maker, the Code-Breaker can use logic to reveal the correct
code. Valid colors are as follows; Red(R), Orange(O), Yellow(Y),
Green(G), Blue(B), and Purple(P). Colors may be repeated, and are
random.

Feedback: The Code-Maker gives feedback to the Code-Breaker with
two colors. Black(B) means that the Code-Breaker has guessed a
correct color, and that it is in the right position. White(W)
means that the Code-Breaker has guessed a correct color, but it
is in the wrong position.
